                <p class="lead">Toward the end of the 19th century, Allen Walker officially joins the organization of Exorcists that destroy the beings known as Akuma; mechanic weapons made by the Millennium Earl with the suffering souls of the dead. Allen has both a cursed eye and an anti-Akuma weapon as an arm, bearing the power of "Innocence," a gift given to him as an apostle of God. Allen, along with his fellow Exorcists must put a stop to the Millennium Earl's ultimate plot that could lead to the destruction of the world and all who live on it.</p>

                    Allen Walker<br>

                   Allen Walker is a warm-hearted 15-year-old British Exorcist and the main protagonist of the series.[vol. 1:62] He turned his adoptive father, Mana Walker, into an Akuma (demon), and during this incident, Allen's left eye was cursed by his father, granting him the ability to see the souls of Akuma, and his left arm awoke as an anti-Akuma weapon.[ch. 3] Allen is revealed to be the 14th Noah, Nea, and will eventually be taken over by Nea's consciousness and become a Noah.[ch. 136,166] As a result, Allen is placed under suspicion and eventually confined.[ch. 202] He is freed by the Noah, causing the Order to revoke his status as an Exorcist and treat him as a Noah, despite the fact he refuses to join the Earl's side.[ch. 204] He vows to refuse help from both the Order and the Noah, but he still considers himself an Exorcist. At the end of Chapter 214, it is shown that he is overtaken by the 14th who had been living in his body for years.[ch. 205]

                   Allen's Innocence starts out as a large grey claw, but during his fight with a Level Two Akuma, his arm begins to evolve and may take on the shape of a large gun when activated.[1] Later on, Allen's Innocence is nearly destroyed by Tyki, but in the process Allen loses his arm.[2] After struggling to reform his Innocence (which has been turned into dust), a Level Three Akuma attacks the Asian Branch where he is recovering. During the fight, Allen realizes that he is fighting for both his friends and the Akuma, and his Innocence is able to realize its true form, the Crown Clown. The Parasite-type anti-Akuma weapon, Crown Clown .[ch. 85], takes the form of a claw on his left hand and a white, hooded, fur cowl. Allen is also able to transform his left arm into a large sword, which resembles The Millennium Earl's but with inverted colors. He can exorcise evil from anything the sword strikes.[ch. 116,117] Allen was voiced by Sanae Kobayashiep. 1 and will be voiced by Ayumu Murase in D.Gray-man Hallow in Japanese.He is voiced by Todd Haberkorn in English.ep. 1

                    Yu Kanda<br>

Yu Kanda is a Second Exorcist, an artificial body possessing the brain of an Exorcist who died thirty years before the storyline. The Black Order launched the Synthetic Disciple Project nine years before the storyline, hoping that Second Exorcists would be able to synchronize with their original Innocence. Because of the project, he is physically 19 years old but has lived for only nine years. As a side effect, he sees lotus flowers blooming wherever he goes; when there was one flower, he was told that it was an illusion, and since then the flowers have multiplied to cover everything.[ch. 186] Kanda was voiced by Takahiro Sakurai[4] and will be voiced by Takuya Sato in D.Gray-man Hallow in Japanese. He is voiced by Travis Willingham in English.ep. 2

                Lenalee Lee<br>
Lenalee Lee is a 16-year-old Exorcist from China.[vol. 1:172] Her parents were killed by an Akuma when she was very young, and she was forced to become an Exorcist as a child. Because she was separated from her brother Komui, her only remaining family member, she repeatedly tried to escape and was restrained. This caused her to hate the Order and Innocence. When Komui joined the Order to be with her, she stopped trying to escape. She now fights for her brother as well as her friends, as she now knows she has a home and family to return to.[ch. 21] Her perception of the "world" consists of her friends and family; whenever one of her friends dies, it seems to her as if a part of her world has been destroyed.[ch. 69]

The Dark Boots, her Equipment-type anti-Akuma weapon, take the form of a pair of black, knee-high boots that give her the ability to run at high speeds, jump to great heights, walk on water, create whirlwinds and use sound waves as footholds.[ch. 18,48,67] To defeat a Level 3 Akuma, she evoked more power out of her Innocence than she could safely handle, reducing her ability to use her boots as well as her physical mobility. During this state, her Innocence would become a crystal to protect her from harm, a behavior unheard of in Innocence.[ch. 71] This caused the Earl to believe that Lenalee might possess the Great Heart. After, when a Level 4 Akuma attacks the HQ, and many people were injured or killed, she expresses a desire to willingly become an Exorcist. Accepting her conviction, the Innocence grants her greater power, becoming a never-before-seen evolved Equipment-type, dubbed a Crystal-type. These new Boots are made up of Lenalee's blood and will repair themselves as long as she has blood in her body. When the Dark Boots are in their dormant state, they form two blood-red anklets.[ch. 157] When Kanda and Johnny ran away, she and Marie keep their location a secret from Komui. Lenalee was voiced by Shizuka Itō and will be voiced by Ai Kakuma in D.Gray-man Hallow in Japanese. She is voiced by Luci Christian in English.ep. 2

Lavi<br> 
Lavi  is a cheerful 18-year-old red-haired Exorcist of mixed heritage. He aims to become a Bookman, a person who records the hidden history of the world, and has been trained from a young age to achieve that goal.[6] Lavi is the 49th alias he assumed after casting away his real name to reach that goal.He works alongside the Black Order just to be close to the events that must be seen, but slowly becomes more attached to his Black Order friends, and his original Bookman self is constantly being clouded by his growing care for them.In recent chapters, he and Bookman were kidnapped by the Clan of Noah and parasites from the Noah were put into Lavi in an attempt to get Bookman to give them information about the 14th Noah. Hoshino was surprised by Lavi's popularity as he made it to the top ten of latest character poll despite his lack of appearances in later story arcs.[9]

His anti-Akuma weapon, simply named Tettsuiand referred to as Ōzuchi Kozuchi, is capable of growing and extending to undefined sizes and lengths.[6][10][11] Although this affects its weight, it seems to not affect Lavi.[12] The weapon allows him to use "Seals" that control several elements of nature.Lavi was voiced by Kenichi Suzumuraand will be voiced by Natsuki Hanae in D.Gray-man Hallow in Japanese. In English, he is voiced by Jason Liebrecht from episodes 13 to 26 and episode 40 onwards, and by Chris Patton in episodes 27 to 39.
